# ANNIP-PatriotHacks2018-
A project created during the Hackathon at George Mason University from 10/12/18 - 10/14/18

This is a Neural Network created during PatriotHack 2018 at George Mason University.

1: Intoduction
Hello, we are a team of three consisting of a freshman and two sophmores.
We really tried our best to learn and create something in such a short amount of time, and it was really fun!

2: Explaining the files

First, you'll notice that the files are named very weirdly and seems very organized. Well you are correct.
This was all of our first time uploading unto Github and ran short on time looking for clean and organized ways to upload them.

  -Machine Learn Testing 1.py:
  This will be our main code consisting of the structure of machine learning and in depth look of the formulas used.
  In order to run this file, first we will need to import the data from the .csv file into our pickle file.
  
  -import2.py
  This is our importing script. We spent way too much time trying to find out how to do this than we would like to admit.
  You will need two .csv data files provided to us by Accenture.
  Sadly, I was not able to upload to main data file because it was too big for Github to allow it. 
  If you want to run the code, please head to http://patriothacks.org/assets/pdf/George%20Mason%20Hackathon_Accenture%20Analytics%20Hack%20Supporting%20Materials_10.12.18.pdf
  for the download link and any extra information.
  
  -ML Tester Algorithm.py
  we're personally not sure if this code work or not, but it's more of a pseudocode than anything really.
  We would like to hopefully be able to use a similar algorithm for more applied usages in real universities. 
  
  -Data_Graphing_ML.py
  This does not work at all, but it's an idea to visuallize the constantly changing values of the weights. Maybe, there is some sort of pattern in that we can detect or just see these life-like growth and change along the x/y graph.
